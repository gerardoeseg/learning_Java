|Represent data     |Add decision-making logic  |
|Create variables   |User conditions            |

Control Flow
- A program's control flow is the order in which the program's instructions or code statements are executed
- All of the programs we've looked so far execute one statement after another, sequentially
- Here is where explanations or definitions can go; try and keep each built two or three lines max

Manipulating Control Flow
- We can manipulate which line of code is executed with special control flow statements and conditions
- A line of code might never be executed, be executed once, or multiple times
- The conditions determine how many times a given line of code is executed

The Fortune Teller Program
- Let's map out the control flow of virtual fortune teller program
- With the fortune teller, the user will pick a number
- Depending on the number picked, the user receives fortune

What Do We Know?
- We know how to output data
- We know how to access user input and save it in a variable
- We do not know how to implement the decisions blocks

Control Flow Statements
- Decision blocks or control flow statements make a decision about code sttements to run on each execution of our program
- Format: < if condition >
- Example: if *inputted number is less than five*
